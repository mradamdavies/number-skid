# Number Skid
Scammer phone number grabber

I made this little Python script to scrape phone numbers from Google. I created it to save copy/pasting while scam baiting.

I'm using it to scam bait tech support scammers. It currently shows numbers for both Amazon scammers and Microsoft scammers. 

I will update this repo when I get time. 


## Usage
Just run:

`python3 nskid.py`
