# Number Skid
Scammer phone number grabber

I made this crappy little Python script to scrape phone numbers from Google. It needs a a lot of work, but I made it quickly to save copy/pasta while scam baiting.

I'm using it to scam bait tech support scammers. I will update this repo when I get time. 

It should be fleshed out over the next week or two. 



## Usage
Just run:

`python3 nskid.py`



## Notes
This is very much a work in progress. 

At the moment it only returns Amazon and Microsoft scammer phone numbers. s
